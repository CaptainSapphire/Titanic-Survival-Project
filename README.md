# Titanic-Survival-Project ⛴️

Welcome! I took inspiration from a range of different sources, which I will link below. <br>
- [Analytics Vidya Tutorial](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/07/titanic-survival-prediction-using-machine-learning/) 
- [Ruban's Repo](https://github.com/Ruban2205/titanic-classification)<br><Br>

## The Project Itself
"The Titanic was a British passenger liner that tragically sank on its maiden voyage in 1912 after striking an iceberg. It was considered the largest and most luxurious ship of its time. The disaster led to the death of over 1,500 people and prompted significant changes in maritime safety regulations" (Wikipedia). <br><br>
The goal of this project is to find out if a passanger survived the tragedy based on given data (gender, class, ticket). 



## The Workflow
