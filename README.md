# Titanic-Survival-Project ‚õ¥Ô∏è

Welcome! I took inspiration from a range of different sources, which I will link below. <br>
- [Analytics Vidya Tutorial](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/07/titanic-survival-prediction-using-machine-learning/) 
- [Ruban's Repo](https://github.com/Ruban2205/titanic-classification)
- [The Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) <br><Br>

## The Project Itself üìé
"The Titanic was a British passenger liner that tragically sank on its maiden voyage in 1912 after striking an iceberg. It was considered the largest and most luxurious ship of its time. The disaster led to the death of over 1,500 people and prompted significant changes in maritime safety regulations" (Wikipedia). <br><br>
The goal of this project is to find out if a passanger survived the tragedy based on given data (gender, class, ticket) using machine learning algorithms. 


## The Workflow ‚è©
All sources establish this as a general workflow, and I will log my progress here as well. 
### Data Pre-processing
We need to drop or autofill null/empty columns, otherwise the data we will be looking at will be incomplete and thus inaccurate. <br><br>

We also need to figure out what columns are relevant to our analysis (so we can drop the useless ones). 

### Data Analysis

### Train Test Split

### Making Models

### Evaluation
